# VocalaTestAP


For the database aspect of the test, i created a Database called HotelManagement. You can see the connection string under appsettings. You will need to either create this yourside, or change the connection string to succesfully use the API.

I've also created a very basic HTML to interact with the webapi. You can find this at the default index.html

Things I would of improved on if I had more time:

- Add comments throughout so the code would be easier to understand and maintain further down the line 
- Add validations the the request model before entering into the database (sql injection and general validations)
- Add these validations to the front end for client side valdiations
- Use JWT to authenticate with the API
- Make sure all methods are running Async to handle large requests
- Build a much better front end :) 

Thanks for your time.
